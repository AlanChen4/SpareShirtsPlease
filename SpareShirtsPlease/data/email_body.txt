Hi there!

Last year, I founded the first computer programming club at Research Triangle High School, a charter school in Durham, NC. 

Based on the feedback from last year's club members, many of my classmates were hesitant to join the programming club since they thought that a career in computer programming meant working at a bland IT company, developing technical products that have little impact on day-to-day life. 

The current members of the club and I want to change this misconception.

As we researched the local technology companies in the RTP, we found a rich variety; this year, our club strategy is to share this existing diversity with other classmates at my school through the school club fair. 

If you are interested in helping us, we were wondering if you would be willing to demonstrate support by sending free merchandise that promotes your company, such as t-shirts or stickers (the mailing address we are using is 8309 Eden Park Drive). Our goal is to display all the support we received at this year's club fair, and give away the merchandise to members of the programming club.

Best,
